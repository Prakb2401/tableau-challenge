### Tableau Challenge

## General Information 
In this challenge I found 3 csv files from Citibike containing information about their services. The first thing I did was combine all the csv files into one dataframe and converted that to a csv. I then imported the combined csv into Tableau and began to make visualizations, dashboards, and a data story

## Technologies used
* Tableau Public
* Jupyter Notebook/Pandas

## Important note
COuld not save the Tableau workbook as a twbx file so I downloded each visualization individually and put them in this repository under the twbx folder.

Tableau public: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prak.bagavatula](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prak.bagavatula)
